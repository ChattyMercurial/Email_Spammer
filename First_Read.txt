Have you ever wondered how your gmail or any other mail clients classify your emails
into spam or ham (basically, non-spam emails) ?!
They basically apply NaÄ«ve Bayes Theorem which is widely used in Machine Learning.
In my emails folder , i have provided some ham and spam mails and we are going to train our model using this data set.
Logic used is simple. Any mail having the word 'free' in it is classified as SPAM.
Based on this we are going to test our model.
